# JavaScript-Quiz
This is just a small website with a simple JavaScript Quiz

This Website is by no means something I am completely satisfied with. I do enjoy the Logic that was put behind it but there's a lot of room for reformatting for re-organizing the code to look much cleaner.

That being said here was the changelog for this document:

1. Started by creating the skeleton `index.html` with all the sections individually named to help organize my thoughts and the overall structure of the final product.
2. started the `script.js` by assigning references to the block level elements that constituted a big portion of the flow of the page.
